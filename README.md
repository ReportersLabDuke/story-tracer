# Story Tracer

Story Tracer is a Chrome extension that identifies the source information that web pages are based upon. Story Tracer uses the [ground-truth](https://github.com/ReportersLabDuke/ground-truth) node library.

## How it works

When you navigate to a webpage with Story Tracer added to Chrome, Story Tracer will try to identify the source behind the webpage by looking at the links on the page. If a likely source is identified, a popup will appear indicating that the page you are on might be based on content from another page:
